# CMSC 11 Essay by Yeona Ellice L. Soleng  
If you asked me a few years ago what I wanted to do, I would have immediately answered engineering. I’ve always been drawn to it, from the fundamentals down to its nitty-gritty parts. But somewhere along the way, as I kept leading, building, and researching, Computer Science kept finding its way into the picture, until I realized that it wasn’t just an extra tool, it was the direction I wanted to move toward.

When I became President of my school’s Engineering Club, I saw it as a chance to bring engineering closer to my classmates. The first thing I worked on was requesting a 3D printer. It took months of asking and pushing before we finally got it, but it was worth it. With it, we taught students how to use SOLIDWORKS, and from there they started designing and printing their own creations. It was fulfilling to see their imaginations come to life, and even more so when they started considering engineering as their own path.

I also wanted to expand our impact outside school, so I organized an outreach program for elementary school kids from financially challenged communities. We introduced them to the basics of engineering and held activities like popsicle stick tower experiments and software bridge building. It was fun, messy, and a little chaotic, but at the end of the day, those kids had huge smiles on their faces. Some of them even told us they wanted to apply to my alma mater, Pisay. Seeing them realize they could belong in STEM, no matter their background, is something I’ll never forget.

But my story doesn’t end in the classroom or with 3D printing. I also saw firsthand the struggles of farmers in Argao, where our school is located. Many of them spend months waiting for soil analysis before they can even decide which fertilizer to use. Some seasons pass them by entirely. Along with two classmates, I started working on a research project: creating a soil quality assessment device using Arduino Mega. The idea was to measure soil organic carbon in minutes, not months, so farmers could make faster and more accurate decisions.
This is when I started appreciating Computer Science more. The sensors and circuits mattered, but what gave the device its real value was the code. It was the logic that made sense of the data and turned it into something farmers could use. That realization stuck with me, that behind every machine, every program, every tool that helps people, there’s Computer Science doing the heavy lifting.

I realized that Computer Science wasn’t just about typing lines into a screen. It was about solving problems and creating systems that could help more people than any single machine could. Hardware has limits, but code can be shared and scaled infinitely.

That’s what excites me most. The thought that something I write in my room could impact people far beyond where I am. I see myself working on projects that combine both hardware and software, but always with people in mind. Whether it’s expanding our soil device into something that learns and improves over time, or developing tools that kids in rural areas can use to learn STEM, I know Computer Science is where those ideas can really grow.

I’m especially drawn to **software engineering**, not because it sounds impressive, but because it feels like the natural way to bring ideas to life. Hardware can only go so far, but with the right software, a device or system can grow, adapt, and be shared with so many more people. Imagine our soil assessment device not just running on basic code, but with software that makes it easier for farmers to use, with interfaces that explain results clearly, or even mobile apps that guide them step by step. That’s the kind of future I want to be part of. A future where the software behind the screen makes technology truly useful for people.

At the same time, I don’t see myself doing this alone. I’ve always been sociable, I thrive in groups, in collaboration, in bouncing ideas off other people. Just as I enjoyed working with my clubmates and with kids in outreach programs, I look forward to joining organizations where Computer Science meets community. I know that the projects I’ll enjoy the most are those created with others, where we brainstorm, test, fail, fix, and succeed together.

So, what brings me to Computer Science is simple. It’s the possibility. The possibility of turning ideas into something real. The possibility of making tools that give people opportunities they didn’t think they could have. And the possibility of combining everything I already love—engineering, research, and teaching—with something that reaches even farther.

*For me, Computer Science is where those dreams and possibilities meet.*
